## Best practices

- Use larger text to emphasize content thatâ€™s not a heading, such as a price total.
- Create contrast between more and less important text with properties such as `size` and `subdued`.

- [`Heading`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Heading): Controls the visual style of headings. Use headings to introduce major sections, like **Contact information**, **Shipping address**, and **Shipping method**.
- [`HeadingGroup`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/HeadingGroup): Controls the H level of headings when nested within the group, like H1, H2, and H3.
- [`TextBlock`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/TextBlock): Renders a block of text that occupies the full width available, like a paragraph.
