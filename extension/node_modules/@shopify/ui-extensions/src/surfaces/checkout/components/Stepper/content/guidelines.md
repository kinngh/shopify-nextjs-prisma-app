## Best practices

- Use this component when customers are likely to choose a number within a small range, such as when changing a quantity from one to three.
- If thereâ€™s no default number, then consider choosing another component such as a [`TextField`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/TextField) or [`Select`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Select).
