## Best practices

- Use lists to break up chunks of related content to make the information easier for customers to scan.
- Phrase list items consistently. Try to start each item with a noun or a verb and be consistent with each item.
- Use bullets for a text-only list of related items that donâ€™t need to be in a specific order.
- Use numbers for a text-only list of related items when you need to communicate order, priority, or sequence.
- Don't use a marker when only the semantic value of a list matters, such as with a list of links.
