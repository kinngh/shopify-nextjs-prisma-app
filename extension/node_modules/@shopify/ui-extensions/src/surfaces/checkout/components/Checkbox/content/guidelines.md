## Best practices

- Frame labels positively. For example, use **Turn on notifications** instead of **Turn off notifications**.
- Be aware of any legal issues around checkboxes. For example, to comply with GDPR, marketing sign-up checkboxes should always be deselected by default.
- Link to more information or include a subtitle as required to provide more explanation. Donâ€™t rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox.
