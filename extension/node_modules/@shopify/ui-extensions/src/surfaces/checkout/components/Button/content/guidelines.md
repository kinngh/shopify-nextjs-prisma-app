## Best practices

- Make button labels clear, so that customers can predict the results of interacting with the button.
- Use primary buttons for actions that progress customers through checkout, such as **Continue to shipping** and **Pay now**.
- Use secondary buttons for actions that you want to draw attention to, but aren't primary, such as **Track your order**.
- Use plain buttons when you want the appearance of a text link with the hit area of a button. This works well alongside other buttons to create hierarchies such as **Continue** and **Return to cart**.
