## Best practices

- If the link isnâ€™t in a paragraph, then consider using a plain button instead for a larger hit area.
- Use links primarily for navigation and use buttons primarily for actions.
- The HTML that renders for the [`Button`](https://github.com/Shopify/ui-extensions/tree/main/packages/checkout-ui-extensions/src/components/Button) and `Link` components includes style and accessibility information. Use these components intentionally and consistently to provide a more inclusive experience for assistive technology users and a more cohesive visual experience for sighted users.
