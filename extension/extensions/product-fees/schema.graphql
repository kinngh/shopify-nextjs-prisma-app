By creating a market, you can configure a distinct, localized shopping experience for
customers from a specific area of the world. For example, you can
[change currency](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/current/mutations/marketCurrencySettingsUpdate),
[configure international pricing](https://shopify.dev/api/examples/product-price-lists),
or [add market-specific domains or subfolders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/current/objects/MarketWebPresence).
